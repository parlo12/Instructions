Key Components
Android SMS Server (Client)
Sends incoming SMS to the WebSocket API.
Receives outgoing SMS instructions from the API.
A unique identifier (e.g., deviceId) registers each Android device.
WebSocket API
Handles real-time communication between Android devices and CRMs.
Authenticates and manages connections from Android devices and CRMs.
Routes SMS data (incoming and outgoing) to the appropriate device/CRM.
CRM Integration
CRMs authenticate with the API using an apiKey.
CRMs send messages via HTTP REST endpoints or WebSocket messages.
CRMs receive SMS delivery receipts and incoming messages in real-time.
Database
Stores messages, devices, API keys, and status logs.
Flowchart
A. Device Registration and Connection

Device Registration:
Android device registers with the API via REST endpoint /registerDevice.
Payload: { "deviceId": "12345", "phoneNumber": "+1234567890" }.
API authenticates and assigns a WebSocket token.
WebSocket Connection:
Android device connects to the API using the WebSocket token.
API verifies token and establishes connection.
B. CRM Registration and Connection

CRM Registration:
CRM registers and receives an apiKey via REST endpoint /registerCRM.
Payload: { "crmName": "CRM Name", "callbackUrl": "https://crm.example.com/webhook" }.
WebSocket Connection:
CRM connects via WebSocket using the apiKey.
C. Message Workflow

1. Incoming SMS (From Android to CRM):
Android device receives an SMS.
SMS is sent to the API via WebSocket:

{
  "deviceId": "12345",
  "messageId": "msg123",
  "sender": "+11234567890",
  "content": "Hello!",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-16T12:00:00Z"
}

API routes the SMS to the associated CRM via WebSocket or webhook.
3. Outgoing SMS (From CRM to Android):
CRM sends an SMS instruction to the API:

{
  "apiKey": "crmApiKey",
  "deviceId": "12345",
  "receiver": "+11234567890",
  "content": "Reply to Hello!"
}

API verifies the apiKey and forwards the SMS to the Android device via WebSocket.
4. Delivery Receipts:
Android device sends delivery status updates:

{
  "deviceId": "12345",
  "messageId": "msg123",
  "status": "DELIVERED",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-16T12:05:00Z"
}



API forwards the status to the CRM.
D. Managing Multiple Devices and CRMs

Each device is uniquely identified by its deviceId.
Each CRM is authenticated by its apiKey.
API maintains a mapping of deviceId to CRMs to ensure messages are routed correctly.

Key Features
Authentication and Security:
Android devices and CRMs authenticate with tokens and apiKeys.
All WebSocket connections are encrypted (e.g., WSS).
Scalability:
Support for multiple Android devices and CRMs.
Horizontal scaling with load balancers.
Error Handling:
Retry logic for failed message deliveries.
Error reporting via WebSocket or REST endpoints.
WebSocket Events:
messageReceived: Sent when an SMS is received.
messageStatus: Sent when an SMS status changes.
deviceConnected: Sent when an Android device connects.
deviceDisconnected: Sent when an Android device disconnects.
Message Queues:
Use a queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ) for reliability in message delivery.
Technologies
API Backend:
Node.js with Express.js for REST endpoints.
Socket.IO for WebSocket communication.
Database:
MongoDB or PostgreSQL for message and device storage.
Android Client:
Kotlin with WebSocket library (e.g., OkHttp).
